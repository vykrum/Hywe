## Philosophy

Hywe is founded on the idea that **spatial reasoning can be expressive and computational without imitating architectural software norms**. It encourages a form of design thinking where **abstract, bubble-like intent guides the creation of layouts**, using a logic-native, procedural approach. Every aspect of the system, from interactivity to structure, has been built from scratch to reflect this paradigm.

At its core, Hywe challenges the assumption that digital tools must replicate conventional processes. Instead, it treats computation as a **generative partner in design**, turning intuition into structured, procedural relationships. This approach enables a **dialogue between spatial logic and creative agency**, supporting designs that are both analytical and expressive.
